Snake 
Matthew Barroso - CS 2110 HW 8

This is the classic game we all know and love, snake!
Press enter at the start screen to begin. Once you're
at the game screen you can press any direction key to begin
moving. Eat the apples to make the snake larger. Don't
run into the walls or yourself or you will DIE. Just like 
that... as is life

# Snake
This is a write up I did for a snake game to be played on a GBA emulator. I recommend following this guide to be able to run it https://www.coranac.com/tonc/text/setup.htm. A .sh file is also included if you want to run it in docker VM. In the VM terminal just type make med in the host directory to run it.
